## AI Integration

### Overview
The Sansof√© Project features an intelligent assistant that enhances user experience through context-aware interactions. The assistant is designed to provide real-time information about local markets in Gran Canaria.

### Key Features

#### ü§ñ Context-Aware Responses
The assistant automatically detects the user's current context:
- Market-specific information when viewing a particular market
- Municipality-focused details when browsing markets in a specific town
- General information about all markets in other contexts

#### üí° Smart Suggestions
Pre-defined quick suggestions help users discover:
- Family-friendly markets
- Gastronomic offerings
- Weekend opening hours
- Location-based recommendations

#### üîÑ Interactive Chat Interface
```javascript
// Example of how the assistant processes context
{
  "query": "What are the opening hours?",
  "marketId": "market123",      // Automatically detected from URL
  "townId": "town456"          
}
```

### Technical Implementation

The AI assistant is implemented through:
- Real-time communication with a specialized AI endpoint
- Context extraction from URL patterns
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Rate limiting protection
- Responsive chat interface
